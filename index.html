     <p><b>NOVEMBER 10, 2021</b> — Women comprise nearly half of the world’s population and yet are underrepresented in most governments.</p>

     <p> Countries like Rwanda, Cuba, and New Zealand have some of the highest proportions of women in their governments. But what accounts for these numbers?</p>

     <p> “It has to do with the electoral system,” said Dr. Carolyn Somerville, professor of political science at Hunter College. “In Rwanda, under list proportional representation, the party makes a list of candidates and makes use of gender quotas. And wherever you have a list proportional representation, you get systems that elect more women.”</p>

  <p> But having impressive female representation does not mean the quality of life for women in these countries is inherently better. “In the end, I wouldn’t say it makes a big difference in terms of policy output,” said Somerville. “It's a good thing but it’s not the panacea.” </p>

  <p><b> Implications?</b></p> <p> While there seems to be an upward trend in most countries, data for 2021 will reveal if and how the pandemic, or the handling of it, has affected political representation for women. </p>
