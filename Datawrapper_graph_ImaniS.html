     <p class="intro"> <p><b>NOVEMBER 10, 2021</b> - Women comprise nearly half of the worldâ€™s population and yet are underrepresented in most governments. </p>

     <p> Countries like Rwanda, Cuba, and New Zealand have some of the highest proportions of women in their governments. And while some have kept up consistent numbers, other countries maintain a steady increase over time. But what accounts for these numbers?</p>

     <iframe title="Gender Breakdown of the World Legislatures &amp;amp; Parliaments" aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-QSKZd" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/QSKZd/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="374"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
     </script>

<p> It varies.</p>

<p> [insert expert quote]. </p>

<p> First, gender quotas reserve seats that only women can hold or make it so that governments must have a certain number of women in office. Second, civil wars and conflict cause major disruptions in social relations, creating new roles for women. In the case of Rwanda, renewed state-building efforts following the 1991 genocide allowed the process to become more inclusive of women. </p>

<p> But having impressive female representation does not mean the quality of life for women in these countries are inherently better. There is still debate among academics about whether having this political presence even benefits or reflects the demands of women in those countries </p>

  <p><b> Implications?</b></p> <p> While there seems to be an upward trend in most countries, which can be explained by gender equity iniatives, data for 2021 will reveal if and how COVID-19 has impacted women's representation in government. </p>
